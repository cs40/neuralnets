# Deep Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit and Face Recognition

## Overview

Built multiple neural networks, with a single hidden layer in order to classify handwritten digits and celebrity images. The images of handwritten digits was obtained from MNIST and the celebrity images were gotten from FaceScrub. The neural networks were implemented in Python using the NumPy and Pytorch libraries. 

## Instructions
All the files from this repository must be downloaded locally in order for the system to work. 
The following commands can be run to execute the different neural networks.

To train and test the neural network for handwritten digit recognition run, `python Digits.py part5`.

To train and test the neural network for face recogntion run, `python faces.py part8`.
